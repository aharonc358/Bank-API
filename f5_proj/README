**Problems and Fixes in the Given Code:**
Problem: The jwtKey ("my_secret_key") is a hardcoded string. This key is used to sign and validate JWT tokens, and if it is known, attackers can forge valid tokens. Hardcoding a key in the source code is unsafe.
Fix: Use environment variables to store the secret key. This ensures that the key is not exposed in the code and can be easily changed without altering the codebase.

Problem: Passwords are being stored and compared as plain text. If the database or the code is compromised, attackers can directly access users' passwords.
Fix: Use password hashing with a secure algorithm like bcrypt to store passwords. This makes it impossible for attackers to retrieve the original passwords even if they gain access to the password database.

Problem: The API does not validate user input for creating users, creating accounts, or making deposits/withdrawals. An attacker can send malformed or malicious data.
Fix: Implement input validation to ensure that all fields meet expected formats, lengths, and ranges before processing:
Validate username
Validate role
Validate password
validateRole
validatePassword
isUsernameTaken

Problem: There was no check on whether the JWT token had expired or been tampered with, other than a basic token validity check.
Fix: Ensure that the token's expiration date is checked and validated properly before allowing access to sensitive endpoints.

Problem: The API uses JWT claims to check if a user has the "admin" role before allowing account creation or other privileged actions. However, it could be improved by ensuring more granular permissions for different roles.
Fix: Improve role-based access control. Ensure that each user role has explicit permissions for certain actions (e.g., admins can create accounts, regular users can only view their own balance).

Problem: Negative withdrawal values were allowed, enabling users to earn money from withdrawals.
Fix: Allow only non-negative numbers in balance-related actions.

Problem: Inefficient methods were used for finding specific accounts or users.
Fix: Use a map to store users/accounts, based on their IDs.

Problem: Unwanted behavior could cause the program to crash.
Fix: Validate incoming requests. If invalid, write an error message and respond with a negative response instead of crashing.

Problem: The auth function did not check tokens thoroughly.
Fix: Ensure that the Auth middleware validates JWT claims to restrict access to protected routes.

Problem: Insecure API endpoints (no authorization check on sensitive routes).
Fix: Protect sensitive endpoints (such as account creation and balance modifications) with proper authentication and authorization checks. Even if a user has a valid JWT, they should only be able to perform actions within their allowed scope. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure only authorized users (e.g., admins) can access privileged routes.

Problem: Tokens could potentially be invalid without proper checks.
Fix: Add error handling for JWT token parsing.

Problem: Invalid HTTP methods could crash the program.
Fix: Add checks for invalid HTTP methods (e.g., GET/POST) in several functions like Register and UserHandler.

Problem: Security problems in the endpoints in the given file.
Fix: Add secure and validated endpoints to ensure no invalid input causes issues, with proper role checks.

Problem: Claims were basic and authenticated based on name/ID only.
Fix: Enhance the claims by adding token expiration time, ID, and additional relevant fields.

**Program Behavior:**
Upon registration, if successful, a user can log in and receive a JWT, which they will use for authentication throughout the program. Users cannot access other users' balances or accounts.
Accounts are created by admins, determined based on their user ID.
Users and accounts are managed using a map (instead of an array), with their ID as the key and the object as the value.
There can be several admins (not limited to one).
For invalid requests, I chose to include informative error messages in the response. The user can retry the request. While this approach may expose an attack surface for the database, given the time constraints, I chose to implement it this way. If I had more time, I would build a mechanism to track potential attacks on the server.

**Suggestions for Further Improvements:**
Build a database using PostgreSQL or an equivalent system.
Implement a smarter mechanism for attack detection, including rate access limiting, etc.
Handle JWT more securely, including expiration, revocation, and additional checks.
Enforce HTTPS instead of HTTP for secure communication.
Add a concurrent mechanism for managing accounts and balances.
